These html files are small iFrames that point to the membership sign up form hosted on Firebase.
These iFrames are added to the squarespace website.

## How to add the iFrame to the squarespace website

Simply copy the block of code into a "Code" element in the squarespace editor.
Use `prod.html` for the production page and `test.html` for the squarespace test page.

`dev.html` is simply used to test the iFrame locally.
