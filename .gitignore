# WHAT DOES THIS FILE DO? #
# A .gitignore file tells Git to ignore the following files or folders.
# If these files or folders are not ignored they will get included on the GitHub.

# The .idea folder is auto-generated by the JetBrains code editor.
# There's no point sharing this configuration folder with everyone so it's ignored.
